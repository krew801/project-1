##MVP
## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
    # People hiring freelancers.
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
    # Struggling with conflicting schedules based on time zone and hiring freelance workers remotely.
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
    # Create a marketplace to promote local startup freelancers for a reasonable price.
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
    # As a hiring manager, I want to find freelancers nearby to collaborate on projects to complete tasks in a convenient timeframe.


* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.
